#### Challenge 20 Supervised Learning
##  credit-risk-classification
#### use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

### Challenge Guidelines:
- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
- Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

### Proposed Technologies:
```yaml
scikit-learn: confusion_matrix, classification_report
Python: Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy
```

### This repo contains the following files:
```yaml
    root\
    - Crypto_Clustering.ipynb - the Jupyter Notebook file with data work
    - README.md

    Resources\
    - crypto_market_data.csv - data set
